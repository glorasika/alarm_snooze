## My Pain Point

My pain point is the snooze button in my alarm, which is 9 minutes and 
it doesn't allow me to customize the snooze time, so I usually overslept.
The reason I create this app is because sometimes I set multiple alarms
e.g. the first one at 9:10 and the last one at 9:40, this is when I have class at 10.
And some times I would fall back to sleep after the last alarm rang, and with the
uncustomizable 9 minutes snooze time, I will definitely be late to class.
So for people like me who are always fall back to sleep after alarm rang,
we need an alarm that can customize our own snooze time, and the perfect 
snooze time for me is 6 minutes.


## The Design

I used light yellow as background color, which I found the color very peaceful 
and blue for appbar background, which the combination is very minimal but not boring.
And I created a total of 4 screens:
- Home screen
  - There is a red button at the bottom of the screen for adding new alarm.
  - When the alarm is added, it will appear on the screen with details about 
    the alarm time and the snooze time.
- Create alarm screen
  - This is for creating a new alarm and the consist of time picker, snooze time 
    and the alarm sound.
- Set snooze time screen
  - This screen allows you to choose a perfect snooze time.
- Choose alarm sound screen
  - This screen allows you to choose an alarm sound that can wake you up in the morning.

## Conclusion

There are actually more features that I wanted to add, but since I have exams this week 
and by the time that I finalized my project idea, I only have few days left to implement it,
so I threw away some of the ideas and at lease implement the feature that 
answer my pain point first. Although, the app is still not perfect, but with the times I have, 
I am actually proud of the final product, and most importantly, the app can run without error messages !!
